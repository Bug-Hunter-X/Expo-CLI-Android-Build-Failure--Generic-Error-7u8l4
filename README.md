# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Generic Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, error encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The error message is often vague, providing little insight into the root cause. This makes debugging quite challenging.

The example project showcases a simple Expo app.  The `expoBug.js` file contains the code for the application, which is intentionally kept simple to isolate the error from complex project structures.  The `expoBugSolution.js` file offers a possible solution, although it might not always resolve the issue as the root cause can vary significantly.

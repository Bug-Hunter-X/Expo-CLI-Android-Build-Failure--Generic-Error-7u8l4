The solution to this problem is not always straightforward and depends on the underlying cause of the build failure.  Some common troubleshooting steps include:

1. **Check Android SDK and NDK Versions:** Ensure you have the correct and compatible versions of the Android SDK and NDK installed.  An outdated or mismatched version can easily lead to build errors.  Use the `sdkmanager` tool to verify and update your components.
2. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild of your project can resolve the issue.  In the terminal, navigate to your project directory and run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android`. 
3. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Investigate your package.json for any conflicting dependencies. It is also advised to update all the dependencies for consistency and best performance.
4. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:** Invalidate the caches for Android Studio and restart the IDE.  This can sometimes clear up temporary files that might be interfering with the build process.
5. **Examine the build logs:** Look closely at the full build logs; they may contain hidden clues about the cause of the failure even if the primary message is vague. Sometimes the error is further up in the logs.
6. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** If the problem persists, create a minimal, reproducible example to pinpoint the problematic elements in your project. This will significantly aid in debugging and potentially in getting help from the Expo community.

This solution attempts to address the typical scenarios behind these generic errors.  The exact fix will vary based on individual project setups and environments.  Remember to consult the Expo documentation and community forums for additional assistance.
